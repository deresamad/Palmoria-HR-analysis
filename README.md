This is a power Bi project on HR analysis of **The Palmoria Group**, a manufacturing company based in the Nigeria
embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions.
Mr Gamma , a director decided to recruit me as a HR Analytics expert to

to demonstrate capabilities in PowerBi_.

manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of
